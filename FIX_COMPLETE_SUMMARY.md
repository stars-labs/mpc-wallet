# Create Wallet Flow Fix - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Enter Key Not Working on CreateWallet Screen
**Problem**: When navigating from MainMenu to CreateWallet, pressing Enter did nothing.
**Root Cause**: Focus remained on MainMenu component instead of transferring to CreateWallet.
**Fix**: Set proper focus when navigating to CreateWallet screen.

### 2. Infinite Navigation Loop  
**Problem**: After selecting mode and returning to CreateWallet, pressing Enter would immediately navigate back to ModeSelection.
**Root Cause**: No state checking before navigation.
**Fix**: Check if mode/curve already selected before navigating to selection screens.

### 3. No Visual Feedback (Missing Checkmarks)
**Problem**: After selecting mode/curve, no checkmarks appeared on the CreateWallet screen.
**Root Cause**: Component wasn't remounting with updated state after returning from selection screens.
**Fix**: Implemented ForceRemount mechanism to refresh UI with updated state.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/elm/message.rs**
   - Added `ForceRemount` message to force UI refresh

2. **src/elm/update.rs**

3. **src/elm/app.rs**
   - Handle ForceRemount flag in remount logic
   - Pass wallet state to CreateWallet component
   - Added logging for debugging

4. **src/elm/components/create_wallet.rs**
   - Added `wallet_state` field to track completion
