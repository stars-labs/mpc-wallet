# Monorepo Migration Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Directory Structure
- Created `apps/` directory for deployable applications
- Created `packages/@mpc-wallet/` for shared packages
- Moved browser extension to `apps/browser-extension/`
- Moved CLI node to `apps/cli-node/`
- Moved WebRTC servers to `apps/signal-server/`

### 2. Workspace Configuration
- Set up Bun workspaces in root `package.json`
- Updated Cargo workspace in `Cargo.toml`
- Fixed dependency paths in `apps/cli-node/Cargo.toml`

### 3. Shared Packages Created
- `@mpc-wallet/core-wasm` - FROST WebAssembly bindings
- `@mpc-wallet/types` - Shared TypeScript types
- `@mpc-wallet/utils` - Common utilities

### 4. Build Infrastructure
- Created `scripts/build-all.sh` for building entire monorepo
- Created `scripts/test-all.sh` for running all tests
- Created `scripts/clean-all.sh` for cleaning artifacts
- Updated `.gitignore` for monorepo structure

### 5. Documentation
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with new file paths
- Created `MONOREPO.md` explaining the structure
- Created this migration summary

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Fix WASM Build**: The core-wasm package needs its dependencies verified
2. **Update Import Paths**: Browser extension imports need to reference the new package locations
3. **CI/CD Updates**: GitHub Actions will need path filters for the monorepo
4. **Test Everything**: Run full test suite to ensure nothing broke

## 📁 New Structure

```
mpc-wallet/
├── apps/
│   ├── browser-extension/    # Main extension app
│   ├── cli-node/            # CLI for MPC nodes
│   └── signal-server/       # WebRTC signaling
├── packages/@mpc-wallet/
│   ├── core-wasm/          # WASM crypto
│   ├── types/              # TypeScript types
│   └── utils/              # Shared utils
├── scripts/                # Monorepo scripts
└── docs/                   # Documentation
```

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Code Sharing**: Types and utilities are now shared across packages
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between apps and libraries
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new packages or apps
4. **Dependency Management**: Bun workspaces handle internal dependencies
5. **Build Optimization**: Can build/test specific packages

## 🔍 Testing the Setup

```bash
# Install all dependencies
bun install

# Build WASM first (may need fixes)
bun run build:wasm

# Run extension in dev mode
bun run dev

# Run all tests
bun run test
```
