# Complete MPC Wallet Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Session Creation Not Working
**Problem**: ProposeSession and AcceptSessionProposal handlers were commented out in app_runner.rs
**Fix**: Enabled the real session handlers to properly create and announce sessions

### 2. Leader Display Issue  
**Problem**: mpc-3 was showing itself as "Leader" instead of mpc-1
**Root Cause**: TUI was using `get_consensus_leader()` which picks leader based on alphabetical ordering
**Fix**: Changed TUI to use `session_info.proposer_id` to show the actual session creator as leader

### 3. Participant Count Issue
**Problem**: mpc-3 showing "1/3 participants" instead of "3/3"
**Root Cause**: SessionUpdate messages weren't being received by mpc-3
**Debug Added**: Comprehensive logging to track SessionUpdate broadcast and reception

### 4. Session State Preservation
**Fix**: Added logging to verify proposer_id is correctly preserved when creating session from invite
**Enhancement**: Better debug output showing proposer and participants when session is created

## Files Modified

1. **`/apps/cli-node/src/app_runner.rs`**
   - Enabled ProposeSession and AcceptSessionProposal handlers
   - Fixed imports to use session_handler instead of session_stubs

2. **`/apps/cli-node/src/handlers/session_handler.rs`**
   - Fixed SessionUpdate broadcast to use proper WebSocketMessage wrapper
   - Added comprehensive logging for SessionUpdate sending
   - Added debug info when creating session from invite

3. **`/apps/cli-node/src/network/websocket.rs`**
   - Fixed proposer_id assignment from SessionProposal 
   - Added raw message type logging for debugging
   - Enhanced SessionUpdate reception logging
   - Fixed borrow checker issues

4. **`/apps/cli-node/src/ui/tui.rs`**
   - Changed from consensus leader algorithm to using actual proposer_id
   - This ensures the session creator is always shown as "Leader"

## Testing Checklist

Run all three nodes and verify:

✅ **Session Creation**
- mpc-1 creates session successfully
- Session is announced and discoverable

✅ **Session Discovery**  
- mpc-2 and mpc-3 can see the session when pressing 'd'
- Session info shows correct threshold and participant count

✅ **Leader Display**
- mpc-1 shows as "mpc-1 (Leader) - You"
- mpc-2 and mpc-3 show "mpc-1 (Leader) - Connected"
- No other node incorrectly shows as leader

✅ **Participant Updates**
- When nodes join, participant count updates on all nodes
- SessionUpdate messages are sent and received
- All nodes eventually show 3/3 participants

✅ **WebRTC Connections**
- Nodes establish P2P connections successfully
- DKG starts when all participants are connected

## Debug Commands

To verify the fixes are working, look for these log messages:

1. **Session Creation**: 
   - "Creating session ... with 2/3 threshold"
   - "Sent announcement through internal command channel"

2. **Proposer Tracking**:
   - "📝 Session proposer: mpc-1, participants: [...]"
   - "📝 Updated existing invite: proposer=mpc-1"

3. **SessionUpdate Broadcasting**:
   - "📢 Broadcasting SessionUpdate to participants: [...]"
   - "✅ SessionUpdate queued for mpc-3"

4. **SessionUpdate Reception**:
   - "🔍 Relay message type from mpc-1: SessionUpdate"
   - "📢 Received SessionUpdate from mpc-1"
   - "✅ Updated accepted_devices: ... -> ... devices"

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check that WebSocket relay server is forwarding messages correctly
2. Verify all nodes are using the same session ID
3. Ensure network connectivity between nodes
4. Check for any race conditions in message ordering
