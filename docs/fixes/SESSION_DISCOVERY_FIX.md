# Session Discovery Fix

## Problem
After the previous fix, sessions created by mpc-1 were not appearing on mpc-2 and mpc-3 when they tried to discover available wallets.

## Root Cause
The ProposeSession and AcceptSessionProposal command handlers were commented out in app_runner.rs, so the session creation and announcement logic was never being executed.

## Fix Applied
1. Enabled the real session handlers in app_runner.rs:
   - Uncommented `handle_propose_session` call
   - Uncommented `handle_accept_session_proposal` call
   - Changed from session_stubs to session_handler module

2. The handlers now properly:
   - Create the session in state
   - Send AnnounceSession message to the WebSocket server
   - Handle session acceptance and broadcast updates

## Files Modified
- `/apps/cli-node/src/app_runner.rs`
  - Enabled ProposeSession handler
  - Enabled AcceptSessionProposal handler
  - Updated imports to use session_handler instead of session_stubs

## Complete Fix Summary
The MPC wallet session flow now works as follows:

1. **Session Creation**: When mpc-1 creates a session, it:
   - Creates session in local state
   - Sends AnnounceSession to WebSocket server
   - Session becomes discoverable by other nodes

2. **Session Discovery**: When mpc-2/mpc-3 refresh sessions, they:
   - Send RequestActiveSessions
   - Receive session announcements from creators
   - Display available sessions in UI

3. **Session Joining**: When a node joins a session:
   - Sends join request to creator
   - Creator sends SessionProposal with all participants
   - Joiner accepts and sends SessionResponse back

4. **Participant Updates**: When someone accepts:
   - Creator broadcasts SessionUpdate to all participants
   - Everyone's UI updates with correct participant count
   - WebRTC connections initiate when all accept

## Testing Instructions
1. Start all three nodes:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin cli-node -- --device-id mpc-1
   cargo run --bin cli-node -- --device-id mpc-2
   cargo run --bin cli-node -- --device-id mpc-3
   ```

2. On mpc-1: Press 'c' to create a session
3. On mpc-2 and mpc-3: Press 'd' to discover wallets
4. Sessions should now appear in the list
5. Select the session to join
6. All nodes should show correct participant counts
7. DKG should start when all are connected
