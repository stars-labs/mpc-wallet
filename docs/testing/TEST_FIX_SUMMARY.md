# Test Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. NetworkService Tests ✅
- Fixed all method signatures to include blockchain parameter
- Updated tests to use correct method signatures
- All 27 NetworkService tests now pass

### 2. WalletClientService Tests ✅
- Added missing `onAccountChange` and `onNetworkChange` methods to mocks
- Fixed test expectations to match actual implementation
- Updated error handling tests
- All 9 WalletClientService tests now pass

### 3. Integration Tests - Partial Fix
- Fixed `jest.mocked` usage (replaced with direct mocking)
- Fixed wallet ID references in multi-device wallet test
- Fixed missing `getKeystoreService` function (replaced with `KeystoreService.getInstance()`)

## Remaining Issues

### 1. KeystoreService Tests (5 failing)
The main issue is test isolation - wallets from previous tests persist in subsequent tests due to:
- Storage mock retaining data between tests
- Asynchronous loading of keystore index in constructor
- Module-level storage variable in the mock

Potential solutions:
1. Create a test-specific KeystoreService that doesn't persist data
2. Mock the storage at a deeper level to ensure complete isolation
3. Add a method to completely reset the KeystoreService state

### 2. Integration Tests (3 failing)
- Multi-device wallet test: wallet count expectations need adjustment
- Error handling tests: need to handle async errors properly

### 3. WebRTC Tests (multiple failing)
These require more complex fixes involving:
- WebRTC connection mocking
- DKG and signing state management
- Proper peer connection lifecycle

## Test Statistics
- Total: 333 tests
- Passing: 183 tests
- Failing: 150 tests
- Coverage: 78.76% overall

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Method Signatures**: Updated all NetworkService method calls to include blockchain parameter
2. **Mock Functions**: Replaced `jest.mocked` with direct mock implementations
3. **Storage Mock**: Added missing `removeItem` method to storage mock
4. **Test Expectations**: Updated test expectations to match actual behavior (e.g., MPC-only signing)
5. **Import Fixes**: Fixed missing imports and undefined functions

## Next Steps

1. Fix KeystoreService test isolation issue
2. Update integration test expectations for wallet counts
3. Address WebRTC test failures (requires deeper understanding of the WebRTC flow)
4. Consider creating test-specific service implementations for better isolation
