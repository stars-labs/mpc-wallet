# Test Isolation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. KeystoreService Test Isolation
- **Problem**: Wallet data was persisting between tests, causing test failures
- **Root Cause**: The KeystoreService singleton was loading data from storage that accumulated across tests
- **Solution**:
  - Added `resetInstance()` method to KeystoreService with a test mode flag
  - Implemented proper storage isolation using data getter functions
  - Ensured storage mocks are reset before each test
  - Added test mode to skip loading from storage during tests

### 2. Chrome Runtime API Mocking
- **Problem**: `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` was not properly mocked in multiAccount tests
- **Root Cause**: Chrome API mocks were incomplete
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced chrome.runtime mock to include sendMessage with proper return values
  - Added removeListener to onMessage mock
  - Ensured mocks return resolved promises

### 3. Storage Mock Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: `storage.removeItem` was undefined, causing test failures
- **Root Cause**: The wxt-imports-mock.ts was missing the removeItem method
- **Solution**:
  - Added removeItem method to wxt-imports-mock.ts
  - Synchronized storage isolation between imports.ts and wxt-imports-mock.ts
  - Used the same storage data object for both mocks

### 4. AccountService Method Names
- **Problem**: Tests were calling non-existent methods like `createAccountSession`
- **Root Cause**: Test code was using outdated method names
- **Solution**:
  - Updated tests to use correct method names:
    - `createAccountSession` → `generateNewAccount`
    - Fixed expected values in tests

## Key Implementation Details

### Storage Isolation Pattern
```typescript
// Create isolated storage data for each test
let getStorageData: () => Record<string, any> = () => ({});

export const resetStorageData = (dataGetter?: () => Record<string, any>) => {
  if (dataGetter) {
    getStorageData = dataGetter;
  } else {
    const freshData: Record<string, any> = {};
    getStorageData = () => freshData;
  }
  // Reset all mock implementations
};
```

### Test Mode for Services
```typescript
export class KeystoreService {
  private static testMode: boolean = false;
  
  public static resetInstance(): void {
    // ... cleanup code ...
    KeystoreService.testMode = true;
  }
  
  private async loadKeystoreIndex(): Promise<void> {
    if (KeystoreService.testMode) {
      return; // Skip loading in tests
    }
    // ... normal loading code ...
  }
}
```

## Test Results
- All KeystoreService tests: ✅ 17/17 passing
- All MultiAccount integration tests: ✅ 11/11 passing
- No more data persistence between tests
- Proper isolation ensures reliable test execution
