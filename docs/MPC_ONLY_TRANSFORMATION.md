# MPC-Only Wallet Transformation Summary

## Overview
The MPC Wallet Chrome extension has been successfully transformed from a dual-mode wallet (supporting both single-party and MPC operations) to an **exclusively MPC-focused wallet** using FROST DKG threshold signatures.

## What Was Removed

### Backend (Rust - `src/lib.rs`)
- `generate_priv_key(curve: &str) -> String` - Private key generation
- `get_eth_address(priv_hex: &str) -> String` - Ethereum address derivation  
- `get_sol_address(priv_hex: &str) -> String` - Solana address derivation
- `eth_sign(priv_hex: &str, message: &str) -> String` - Ethereum message signing
- `sol_sign(priv_hex: &str, message: &str) -> String` - Solana message signing

### Frontend (`src/entrypoints/popup/App.svelte`)
- **State Variables**: `private_key`, `address`, `signature`, `error`, `addressType`
- **Functions**: `ensurePrivateKey()`, `fetchAddress()`, `signDemoMessage()`
- **UI Components**:
  - Address type selection fieldset (Single-Party vs DKG toggle)
  - Single-party address generation button
  - Single-party message signing button
  - Single-party address display
  - Single-party signature display
- **Reactive Statements**: All logic handling single-party operations

## What Remains (MPC Features)

### âœ… Fully Functional
- **FROST DKG Protocol**: Ed25519 and Secp256k1 curve support
- **WebRTC P2P Communication**: Mesh network establishment
- **Session Management**: Threshold signature session coordination
- **DKG Address Generation**: Ethereum and Solana address derivation from distributed keys
- **State Management**: Background script coordination and UI synchronization

### ðŸ”„ Future Implementation
- **Threshold Signature Operations**: Distributed message/transaction signing
- **dApp Integration**: Web3 provider for MPC-based signing

## User Experience Changes

### Before (Dual-Mode)
Users could choose between:
1. **Single-Party Mode**: Traditional private key operations
2. **DKG Mode**: Multi-party threshold signatures

### After (MPC-Only)
Users can only:
1. **Join/Create DKG Sessions**: Participate in distributed key generation
2. **Generate MPC Addresses**: Get blockchain addresses from threshold keys
3. **Access Threshold Features**: Use distributed cryptographic operations

## Technical Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed complexity of dual-mode operations
2. **Enhanced Security**: Eliminated single points of failure (private keys)
3. **Focused Development**: All efforts now directed toward MPC improvements
4. **Cleaner Codebase**: Reduced surface area for bugs and maintenance

## Build Verification

- âœ… Rust/WASM compilation successful
- âœ… Frontend TypeScript compilation clean
- âœ… Development server operational  
- âœ… Extension loads correctly in Chrome
- âœ… All DKG functionality preserved

## Files Modified

1. **`src/lib.rs`** - Removed single-party cryptographic functions
2. **`src/entrypoints/popup/App.svelte`** - Simplified UI to MPC-only
3. **`progress.md`** - Updated with completion status
4. **`memory-bank/progress.md`** - Detailed change log

The MPC Wallet is now a **pure threshold signature solution** focused exclusively on Multi-Party Computation security models.
