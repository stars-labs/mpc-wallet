# DKG Address UI Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented UI functionality to display DKG-generated addresses for both Ethereum and Solana in the MPC wallet Chrome extension. The UI now supports both single-party and DKG (MPC) address generation with a clean interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Address Type Selection
- **Toggle between Single-Party and DKG modes**: Users can switch between traditional single-party addresses and DKG-generated MPC addresses
- **Visual indication of availability**: DKG option is disabled until a DKG session is completed
- **Status indicators**: Real-time status showing when DKG is complete and MPC addresses are available

### 2. DKG Address Display
- **Ethereum DKG addresses**: Retrieves addresses from completed FROST DKG sessions
- **Solana DKG addresses**: Supports both blockchains with appropriate formatting
- **Threshold signature indication**: Shows the threshold configuration (e.g., "2-of-3") used to generate the address
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages when DKG addresses are not available

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Auto-refresh functionality**: Automatically fetches DKG addresses when DKG completes
- **Smart address switching**: Clears previous addresses when switching between modes
- **Blockchain status indication**: Shows DKG completion status per blockchain
- **Accessibility compliance**: Proper form labels and semantic HTML

### 4. Visual Design
- **Purple theme for DKG**: Distinct color scheme (purple) for MPC functionality vs blue for single-party
- **Status badges**: Green checkmarks for completed DKG, yellow progress indicators
- **Responsive layout**: Clean, organized interface that fits the extension popup

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration
- **WebRTCManager.getEthereumAddress()**: Added method to retrieve Ethereum DKG addresses
- **Offscreen document handlers**: Added "getEthereumAddress" command handler
- **FROST DKG integration**: Uses existing `get_eth_address()` and `get_sol_address()` from WASM bindings

### Frontend Components
- **Address type toggle**: Fieldset with radio-style buttons for accessibility
- **Dynamic address display**: Conditional rendering based on selected address type
- **Real-time state management**: Reactive updates when DKG state changes
- **Error boundaries**: Proper error handling and display for DKG operations

### State Management
```typescript
// New state variables added to App.svelte
let dkgAddress: string = "";
let dkgError: string = "";
let addressType: "single-party" | "dkg" = "single-party";
```

### Key Functions
- **`fetchDkgAddress()`**: Retrieves DKG addresses via chrome.runtime.sendMessage()
- **Auto-refresh reactive statements**: Automatically fetch addresses on state changes
- **Address formatting**: Consistent display formatting for both blockchains

## UI Flow

### Single-Party Mode (Default)
1. User selects "Single-Party" address type
2. Clicks "Generate Single-Party Address"
3. Traditional private key-based address is generated and displayed
4. User can sign messages with single-party key

### DKG Mode (MPC)
1. User completes a DKG session (threshold signature setup)
2. DKG option becomes enabled with visual confirmation
3. User selects "DKG (MPC)" address type
4. Clicks "Get DKG Address" or address auto-loads
5. MPC address is displayed with threshold configuration info
6. Signing shows "Coming Soon" placeholder for future MPC signing implementation

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Load the extension in Chrome developer mode
3. Open the extension popup

### Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Single-Party Address Generation
1. Ensure "Single-Party" is selected (default)
2. Select blockchain (Ethereum or Solana)
3. Click "Generate Single-Party Address"
4. Verify address appears in standard format
5. Test message signing functionality

#### Test 2: DKG Address Display (Without Active DKG)
1. Click "DKG (MPC)" button
2. Verify it's disabled with explanatory text
3. Check that status shows "Complete a DKG session to generate MPC addresses"

#### Test 3: DKG Address Display (With Completed DKG)
1. Complete a DKG session first (see DKG_TEST_GUIDE.md)
2. DKG option should become enabled
3. Select "DKG (MPC)" address type
4. Address should auto-load or click "Get DKG Address"
5. Verify DKG address displays with threshold info

#### Test 4: Blockchain Switching
1. Switch between Ethereum and Solana
2. Verify addresses update appropriately for each blockchain
3. Test both single-party and DKG modes with blockchain switching

#### Test 5: Error Handling
1. Try to get DKG address without completed DKG
2. Verify error message appears
3. Test with network disconnection scenarios

## Code Structure

### Modified Files
- **`src/entrypoints/popup/App.svelte`**: Main UI components and state management
- **`src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.ts`**: Added `getEthereumAddress()` method
- **`src/entrypoints/offscreen/index.ts`**: Added "getEthereumAddress" command handler

### Key UI Components
```svelte
<!-- Address Type Selection -->
<fieldset>
  <legend class="font-bold mb-2">Address Type:</legend>
  <div class="flex gap-2">
    <button class="single-party-btn">Single-Party</button>
    <button class="dkg-btn" disabled={!isDkgComplete}>DKG (MPC)</button>
  </div>
</fieldset>

<!-- DKG Address Display -->
{#if addressType === 'dkg' && dkgAddress}
  <div class="dkg-address-display">
    <code class="bg-purple-50">{dkgAddress}</code>
    <p class="threshold-info">✓ Generated using 2-of-3 threshold signature</p>
  </div>
{/if}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **MPC Message Signing**: Implement distributed signing for DKG addresses
2. **Address Verification**: Add address validation and checksums
3. **Export Functionality**: Allow users to copy/export DKG addresses

### Advanced Features
1. **Multi-Session Support**: Handle multiple DKG sessions with different configurations
2. **Address History**: Store and display previously generated DKG addresses
3. **Performance Optimization**: Cache DKG addresses to reduce redundant calls
4. **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms for failed DKG address retrieval

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **DKG Session Management**: Integrates with existing session proposal/acceptance flow
- **WebRTC Communication**: Uses established peer-to-peer communication
- **FROST DKG Protocol**: Leverages completed threshold signature implementation
- **Extension Architecture**: Follows established popup ↔ background ↔ offscreen communication pattern

### External Dependencies
- **FROST DKG WASM**: Uses `get_eth_address()` and `get_sol_address()` methods
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: chrome.runtime.sendMessage() for cross-context communication
- **Svelte Reactivity**: Reactive statements for automatic UI updates

## Security Considerations

1. **Address Verification**: DKG addresses are generated using cryptographically secure threshold signatures
2. **State Isolation**: Single-party and DKG addresses are clearly separated in UI and state
3. **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling prevents information leakage
4. **Access Control**: DKG addresses only available after successful threshold key generation

## Performance

- **Lazy Loading**: DKG addresses only fetched when needed
- **Reactive Updates**: Efficient state management with Svelte reactivity
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal state storage for address information
- **Fast Switching**: Instant toggling between address types

## Success Metrics

✅ **UI Implementation Complete**: Address type selection and display working
✅ **DKG Integration**: Successfully retrieves addresses from completed DKG sessions  
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error states and user feedback
✅ **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper form controls
✅ **Visual Design**: Consistent with extension theme and clear differentiation
✅ **Auto-refresh**: Addresses update automatically when DKG completes
✅ **Cross-blockchain**: Works for both Ethereum and Solana
✅ **Build Success**: Extension compiles and runs without errors

The DKG address UI implementation is now complete and ready for user testing!
