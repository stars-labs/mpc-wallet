## Security Principles

### Core Security Properties

1. **Threshold Security**: No single party can compromise the system
2. **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications are encrypted
3. **Zero Knowledge**: Parties learn nothing beyond their authorized information
4. **Forward Secrecy**: Past communications remain secure even if keys are compromised
5. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls

### Security Assumptions

- **Honest Majority**: At least t out of n participants are honest
- **Secure Channels**: TLS/DTLS provide confidentiality and integrity
- **Cryptographic Hardness**: Standard cryptographic assumptions hold
- **Secure Random Generation**: System has access to cryptographically secure randomness

## Threat Model Summary

### In Scope Threats

- **Key Extraction Attempts**: Attempts to recover complete private keys
- **Network Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, replay attacks
- **Malicious Participants**: Up to t-1 dishonest participants
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing and power analysis attacks
- **Denial of Service**: Attempts to disrupt availability

### Out of Scope Threats

- **Physical Access**: Direct physical access to devices
- **Supply Chain**: Compromised hardware or dependencies
- **Quantum Computing**: Post-quantum cryptographic attacks
- **Social Engineering**: Non-technical attacks on users

## Security Checklist

### Development
- [ ] All inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Cryptographic operations use constant-time implementations
- [ ] Sensitive data is securely erased after use
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] All dependencies are from trusted sources

### Deployment
- [ ] TLS/HTTPS enabled for all communications
- [ ] Secure key storage mechanisms in place
- [ ] Access controls properly configured
- [ ] Audit logging enabled and monitored
- [ ] Regular security updates applied

### Operations
- [ ] Regular security audits conducted
- [ ] Incident response plan tested
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures verified
- [ ] Access logs regularly reviewed
- [ ] Security training completed

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security@mpc-wallet.io with details
3. Include steps to reproduce if possible
4. Allow up to 90 days for a fix before public disclosure
