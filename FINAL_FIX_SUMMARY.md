# Final Fix Summary - MPC Wallet TUI Navigation

## ✅ Problem Solved

User reported: "enter not works on mpc-1" when trying to navigate from CreateWallet to mode selection screen.

## Root Cause

The `model.wallet_state.creating_wallet` state was persisting between wallet creation attempts. When users:
1. Selected a mode (e.g., Online) 
2. Went back to main menu
3. Tried to create another wallet

The old state `mode: Some(Online)` was still there, blocking navigation with "Mode already selected" logic.

## The Fix

**File: `src/elm/update.rs` (line 490)**

```rust
// IMPORTANT: Reset the creating_wallet state to start fresh
model.wallet_state.creating_wallet = None;
info!("Reset creating_wallet state to None for fresh start");
```

When navigating to CreateWallet from MainMenu, we now reset the `creating_wallet` state to `None`, ensuring a fresh start every time.

## Complete Solution Components

1. **State Reset** - Clear old state when starting new wallet creation
2. **Focus Management** - Properly transfer focus to CreateWallet component
3. **ForceRemount** - Refresh UI with updated state after selections
4. **Navigation Guards** - Check if mode/curve already selected before navigating

## Verification

The logs now show:
```
INFO: Navigating to Create Wallet
INFO: Reset creating_wallet state to None for fresh start
INFO: Mounting CreateWallet component with state: None
```

## How to Test

Run `./test-state-reset.sh` or manually:
1. Create wallet → Select mode → Go back
2. Create wallet again → Should work perfectly
3. No more "Mode already selected" blocking navigation

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Users can now navigate through wallet creation multiple times without state persistence issues.
