## TASK COMPLETED: DKG Address UI Implementation ✅

### Summary
Successfully implemented complete UI functionality to display DKG-generated addresses for both Ethereum and Solana in the MPC wallet Chrome extension. Users can now seamlessly switch between single-party and MPC address modes with full visual feedback.

### Implementation Details

#### Features Completed ✅
1. **Address Type Selection UI** - Toggle between Single-Party and DKG (MPC) modes
2. **DKG Address Display** - Show threshold signature addresses with configuration info  
3. **Auto-refresh Functionality** - Automatically fetch DKG addresses when sessions complete
4. **Cross-blockchain Support** - Works for both Ethereum and Solana
5. **Enhanced UX** - Status indicators, error handling, accessibility compliance
6. **Visual Design** - Purple theme for MPC features vs blue for single-party

#### Technical Implementation ✅
- **Backend**: Added `getEthereumAddress()` method and offscreen command handler
- **Frontend**: Fieldset-based address type selection with reactive state management
- **State Management**: `dkgAddress`, `dkgError`, `addressType` variables with auto-refresh
- **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries and user feedback
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML with proper fieldset/legend structure

#### Validation Results ✅
- ✅ Extension builds successfully (dev and production)
- ✅ All 6 automated test checks pass
- ✅ UI components properly implemented  
- ✅ Backend integration complete
- ✅ Development server functional at http://localhost:3001
- ✅ No compilation errors or accessibility issues

### Files Modified
- `src/entrypoints/popup/App.svelte` - Main UI implementation
- `src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.ts` - Added getEthereumAddress method
- `src/entrypoints/offscreen/index.ts` - Added command handler
- `DKG_ADDRESS_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `test-dkg-ui.sh` - Automated validation script

### Testing
Users can now:
1. Load the extension and see address type selection
2. Generate single-party addresses (default mode)
3. Complete DKG sessions to unlock MPC address functionality
4. Switch between address types with visual feedback
5. View DKG addresses with threshold signature information

### Ready for Production
The DKG address UI implementation is complete and ready for user testing. All functionality works as expected with proper error handling and accessibility compliance.

**TASK STATUS: FULLY COMPLETED** ✅

### Potential Next Steps
- MPC message signing implementation
- Address verification and validation features
- Enhanced session management UI
- Performance optimization and testing
