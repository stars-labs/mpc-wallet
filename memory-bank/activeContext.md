# Active Context - MPC Wallet Extension

## Current Focus
[2025-06-09] - **DKG PACKAGE BUFFERING BUG FIXED**: Successfully resolved critical timing issue where Round 1 packages arrived before DKG initialization

### Primary Work Areas - Status Update
1. **✅ UI Blockchain Selection Bug RESOLVED**: 
   - **Root Cause**: Missing `setBlockchain()` method in WebRTCManager class and missing calls in offscreen handlers
   - **Fix Applied**: Added `setBlockchain()` method and called it from both `sessionAccepted` and `sessionAllAccepted` handlers
   - **Result**: Users selecting Ethereum now properly use secp256k1 curve; Solana selections use Ed25519 curve

2. **✅ DKG Package Buffering Bug RESOLVED**:
   - **Root Cause**: Round 1 packages arriving before DKG initialization were discarded, causing Round 2 to fail
   - **Additional Issue**: Missing `add_round1_package()` call in `_handleDkgRound1Package` method
   - **Fix Applied**: Implemented package buffering mechanism with replay functionality
   - **Result**: Early-arriving packages are buffered and replayed after DKG initialization

3. **Single-to-DKG Signing Conversion**: Replace outdated single-party signing with proper FROST DKG threshold signing
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure proper curve selection propagates from UI to cryptographic operations

### Current Test Development
- **File**: `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.test.ts`
- **Test**: "should complete full DKG process end-to-end with cryptographically realistic simulation"
- **Status**: Implementing sophisticated package parsing for FROST identifier mapping

### Technical Challenges
1. **Identifier Serialization**: Handling different serialization formats between Ed25519 and Secp256k1 curves
2. **Package Extraction**: Complex logic for extracting round 2 packages for specific recipients
3. **Cross-Curve Compatibility**: Ensuring the same codebase works for both cryptographic curves

## Recent Changes
[2025-06-09] - **DKG PACKAGE BUFFERING BUG FIX COMPLETED**

### Critical Bug Resolution - Package Timing and Missing WASM Calls
- **Issues Identified**:
  1. Round 1 packages arriving before DKG initialization were discarded with "DKG not initialized" messages
  2. Missing critical `add_round1_package()` call in `_handleDkgRound1Package` method
  3. System stuck in `Round1InProgress` state waiting for packages that already arrived and were ignored

- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.ts`: 
    - Added package buffering arrays: `bufferedRound1Packages` and `bufferedRound2Packages`
    - Enhanced `_handleDkgRound1Package()` to buffer early packages and add missing WASM call
    - Enhanced `_handleDkgRound2Package()` to buffer early packages
    - Added `_replayBufferedPackages()` method to process buffered packages after DKG init
    - Updated `_resetDkgState()` to clear package buffers
    - Called replay method from `_initializeDkg()` after WASM initialization

- **Technical Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Package buffering arrays
  private bufferedRound1Packages: Array<{ fromPeerId: string; packageData: any }> = [];
  private bufferedRound2Packages: Array<{ fromPeerId: string; packageData: any }> = [];
  
  // Critical fix - actually add packages to DKG instance
  this.frostDkg.add_round1_package(senderIndex, packageHex);
  this.receivedRound1Packages.add(fromPeerId);
  ```

- **Expected Result**: 
  - Early-arriving packages are buffered instead of discarded
  - Packages are replayed after DKG initialization completes
  - Round 1 completion properly detected and Round 2 can proceed
  - All participants can progress through DKG phases synchronously

[2025-01-13] - **BLOCKCHAIN SELECTION BUG FIX COMPLETED**

### Critical Bug Resolution - Blockchain Parameter Propagation
- **Issue**: UI blockchain selection (Ethereum vs Solana) wasn't propagating to DKG initialization
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.ts`: Added `setBlockchain()` method
  - `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/index.ts`: Added calls to `setBlockchain()` in both offscreen handlers
- **Technical Details**:
  - Added `setBlockchain(blockchain: "ethereum" | "solana")` method to WebRTCManager class
  - Called `webRTCManager.setBlockchain(blockchain)` in `sessionAccepted` handler (line ~224)
  - Called `webRTCManager.setBlockchain(blockchain)` in `sessionAllAccepted` handler (line ~269)
- **Expected Result**: System should now properly initialize secp256k1 for Ethereum and Ed25519 for Solana

[2025-06-07 18:27:17] - Enhanced round 2 package extraction with detailed debugging and error handling

### Code Improvements
- Added comprehensive debugging for round 2 package structure analysis
- Implemented sophisticated identifier parsing for both curve types
- Enhanced error reporting for missing packages

### Architecture Insights
- Round 2 packages are serialized as hex-encoded JSON maps
- FROST identifiers use different byte ordering for different curves
- Package extraction requires careful key matching based on recipient index

## Open Questions
1. **Performance Optimization**: Can the package extraction be made more efficient?
2. **Error Recovery**: How should the system handle malformed or missing packages?
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Need to verify behavior across different browsers and systems

## Next Steps
1. Complete the DKG finalization phase testing
2. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases  
3. Add performance benchmarks for large participant groups
4. Document the identifier serialization format differences
