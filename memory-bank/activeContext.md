# Active Context - MPC Wallet Extension

## Current Focus
[2025-06-12] - **DKG ROUND 1‚Üí2 TRANSITION DEBUG ENHANCEMENT**: Enhanced diagnostic capabilities to investigate why mpc-2 receives all Round 1 packages but WASM reports `can_start_round2: false`

### Primary Work Areas - Status Update

**CURRENT INVESTIGATION**:
1. **üîç DKG Round 1‚Üí2 Transition Debug Enhancement**: 
   - **Root Cause**: mpc-2 receives all Round 1 packages but WASM reports `can_start_round2: false` (only 1 package counted instead of 3)
   - **Investigation**: Enhanced `_replayBufferedDkgPackages()` with comprehensive debugging to track exactly what happens when buffered packages from CLI nodes are processed
   - **Status**: Debug-enhanced version built and ready for testing
   - **Next Step**: Deploy enhanced version and analyze detailed logs to identify why buffered packages fail to add to WASM

**PREVIOUSLY FIXED**:
1. **üî• CRITICAL BUG FIXED - WebRTC Connection Crash**:
   - **Root Cause**: Missing `setBlockchain` handler in offscreen document caused cascade of failures leading to document recreation during active sessions
   - **Impact**: Each offscreen recreation destroyed all WebRTC peer connections, causing connection crashes for users like mpc-2
   - **Files Modified**:
     - `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/index.ts`: Added `setBlockchain` message handler (line ~462)
     - `/src/types/messages.ts`: Added `setBlockchain` to OffscreenMessage type
     - `/src/entrypoints/background/index.ts`: Enhanced recreation logic to avoid destroying active WebRTC connections
   - **Technical Details**:
     - Added case handler for `setBlockchain` that calls `webRTCManager.setBlockchain(payload.blockchain)`
     - Enhanced `safelySendOffscreenMessage()` to check for active WebRTC connections before recreating offscreen
     - Prevents offscreen recreation when `hasActiveSession && hasActiveConnections` to preserve WebRTC state
   - **Result**: WebRTC connections should now remain stable during blockchain switching and other operations

2. **üî• CRITICAL BUG FIXED - DKG Round 2 Stuck**:
   - **Root Cause**: When Round 2 packages were received while node was still in Round1InProgress state, they got buffered but never processed after transitioning to Round2InProgress
   - **Impact**: Nodes like mpc-2 would receive Round 2 packages from others but never send their own or progress to finalization
   - **File Modified**: `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.ts`
   - **Technical Details**:
     - Added call to `_replayBufferedDkgPackages()` after `_generateAndBroadcastRound2()` in `_handleDkgRound1Package`
     - This ensures buffered Round 2 packages are processed immediately after transitioning to Round 2 state
     - Fixes the race condition where fast nodes send Round 2 packages before slower nodes complete Round 1
   - **Result**: DKG process should now complete successfully without getting stuck at Round 2

3. **üî• CRITICAL BUG FIXED - FROST DKG Self-Package Processing**:
   - **Root Cause**: Nodes were trying to add their own Round 1 packages to FROST DKG via `add_round1_package()`, but FROST DKG already includes the node's own package when `generate_round1()` is called
   - **Impact**: WASM library was rejecting the duplicate self-package, causing DKG to fail immediately after Round 1 generation
   - **File Modified**: `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.ts`
   - **Technical Details**:
     - Added check in `_handleDkgRound1Package()` to skip processing when `fromPeerId === this.localPeerId`
     - Modified `_generateAndBroadcastRound1()` to just add own package to received set instead of processing it
     - Added enhanced WASM error logging to identify the root cause
   - **Result**: FROST DKG Round 1 processing now works correctly without self-package duplication errors

4. **‚úÖ TEST COVERAGE TARGET ACHIEVED**: Successfully reached 85.12% functions, 83.12% lines coverage with core services exceeding 90%+ 
   - **Core Services**: All exceed 90%+ coverage (NetworkService: 100%, AccountService: 97.87%, WalletController: 100%, WalletClient: 91.11%)
   - **Overall Coverage**: 171 passing tests, comprehensive error handling
   - **Result**: Robust test infrastructure with real cryptographic testing

### Current Test Development
- **File**: `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.test.ts`
- **Test**: "should complete full DKG process end-to-end with cryptographically realistic simulation"
- **Status**: Implementing sophisticated package parsing for FROST identifier mapping

### Technical Challenges
1. **Identifier Serialization**: Handling different serialization formats between Ed25519 and Secp256k1 curves
2. **Package Extraction**: Complex logic for extracting round 2 packages for specific recipients
3. **Cross-Curve Compatibility**: Ensuring the same codebase works for both cryptographic curves

## Recent Changes
[2025-06-09] - **DKG PACKAGE BUFFERING BUG FIX COMPLETED**

### Critical Bug Resolution - Package Timing and Missing WASM Calls
- **Issues Identified**:
  1. Round 1 packages arriving before DKG initialization were discarded with "DKG not initialized" messages
  2. Missing critical `add_round1_package()` call in `_handleDkgRound1Package` method
  3. System stuck in `Round1InProgress` state waiting for packages that already arrived and were ignored

- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.ts`: 
    - Added package buffering arrays: `bufferedRound1Packages` and `bufferedRound2Packages`
    - Enhanced `_handleDkgRound1Package()` to buffer early packages and add missing WASM call
    - Enhanced `_handleDkgRound2Package()` to buffer early packages
    - Added `_replayBufferedPackages()` method to process buffered packages after DKG init
    - Updated `_resetDkgState()` to clear package buffers
    - Called replay method from `_initializeDkg()` after WASM initialization

- **Technical Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Package buffering arrays
  private bufferedRound1Packages: Array<{ fromdeviceId: string; packageData: any }> = [];
  private bufferedRound2Packages: Array<{ fromdeviceId: string; packageData: any }> = [];
  
  // Critical fix - actually add packages to DKG instance
  this.frostDkg.add_round1_package(senderIndex, packageHex);
  this.receivedRound1Packages.add(fromdeviceId);
  ```

- **Expected Result**: 
  - Early-arriving packages are buffered instead of discarded
  - Packages are replayed after DKG initialization completes
  - Round 1 completion properly detected and Round 2 can proceed
  - All participants can progress through DKG phases synchronously

[2025-01-13] - **BLOCKCHAIN SELECTION BUG FIX COMPLETED**

### Critical Bug Resolution - Blockchain Parameter Propagation
- **Issue**: UI blockchain selection (Ethereum vs Solana) wasn't propagating to DKG initialization
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.ts`: Added `setBlockchain()` method
  - `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/index.ts`: Added calls to `setBlockchain()` in both offscreen handlers
- **Technical Details**:
  - Added `setBlockchain(blockchain: "ethereum" | "solana")` method to WebRTCManager class
  - Called `webRTCManager.setBlockchain(blockchain)` in `sessionAccepted` handler (line ~224)
  - Called `webRTCManager.setBlockchain(blockchain)` in `sessionAllAccepted` handler (line ~269)
- **Expected Result**: System should now properly initialize secp256k1 for Ethereum and Ed25519 for Solana

[2025-06-07 18:27:17] - Enhanced round 2 package extraction with detailed debugging and error handling

### Code Improvements
- Added comprehensive debugging for round 2 package structure analysis
- Implemented sophisticated identifier parsing for both curve types
- Enhanced error reporting for missing packages

### Architecture Insights
- Round 2 packages are serialized as hex-encoded JSON maps
- FROST identifiers use different byte ordering for different curves
- Package extraction requires careful key matching based on recipient index

## Open Questions
1. **Performance Optimization**: Can the package extraction be made more efficient?
2. **Error Recovery**: How should the system handle malformed or missing packages?
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Need to verify behavior across different browsers and systems

## Next Steps
1. Complete the DKG finalization phase testing
2. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases  
3. Add performance benchmarks for large participant groups
4. Document the identifier serialization format differences
