# Active Context - MPC Wallet Extension

## Current Focus
[2025-06-07 18:27:17] - Analyzing and enhancing FROST DKG implementation in webrtc.test.ts

### Primary Work Areas
1. **FROST DKG Testing**: Working on comprehensive end-to-end DKG tests for both Ed25519 and Secp256k1 curves
2. **Round 2 Package Exchange**: Debugging and optimizing the complex package extraction logic for different cryptographic identifiers
3. **WebRTC Integration**: Ensuring seamless integration between WebRTC communication and FROST cryptographic operations

### Current Test Development
- **File**: `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/webrtc.test.ts`
- **Test**: "should complete full DKG process end-to-end with cryptographically realistic simulation"
- **Status**: Implementing sophisticated package parsing for FROST identifier mapping

### Technical Challenges
1. **Identifier Serialization**: Handling different serialization formats between Ed25519 and Secp256k1 curves
2. **Package Extraction**: Complex logic for extracting round 2 packages for specific recipients
3. **Cross-Curve Compatibility**: Ensuring the same codebase works for both cryptographic curves

## Recent Changes
[2025-06-07 18:27:17] - Enhanced round 2 package extraction with detailed debugging and error handling

### Code Improvements
- Added comprehensive debugging for round 2 package structure analysis
- Implemented sophisticated identifier parsing for both curve types
- Enhanced error reporting for missing packages

### Architecture Insights
- Round 2 packages are serialized as hex-encoded JSON maps
- FROST identifiers use different byte ordering for different curves
- Package extraction requires careful key matching based on recipient index

## Open Questions
1. **Performance Optimization**: Can the package extraction be made more efficient?
2. **Error Recovery**: How should the system handle malformed or missing packages?
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Need to verify behavior across different browsers and systems

## Next Steps
1. Complete the DKG finalization phase testing
2. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases  
3. Add performance benchmarks for large participant groups
4. Document the identifier serialization format differences
