## Overview

### What is Offline DKG?

Offline DKG is a process where multiple parties generate cryptographic key shares without any network connectivity. Data exchange happens exclusively through physical media (SD cards/USB drives), ensuring complete air-gap security.

### Why Use Offline DKG?

- **Maximum Security**: No network attack surface
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets strict air-gap requirements
- **Verifiable Process**: Every step can be independently verified
- **Physical Control**: Complete control over data flow

### Process Timeline

| Phase | Coordinator Time | Participant Time | Total Time |
|-------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| Setup | 30 minutes | 15 minutes | 30 minutes |
| Round 1 | 45 minutes | 30 minutes | 45 minutes |
| Round 2 | 60 minutes | 45 minutes | 60 minutes |
| Finalization | 30 minutes | 20 minutes | 30 minutes |
| **Total** | **2.5-3 hours** | **2 hours** | **3-4 hours** |

## Verification Procedures

### At Each Round

1. **File Integrity**
   ```bash
   # Generate checksum
   sha256sum round1_P1_commitment.json > checksums.txt
   
   # Verify checksum
   sha256sum -c checksums.txt
   ```

2. **Signature Verification**
   - Each file should be signed by sender
   - Verify using participant's public key
   - Reject unsigned or invalid signatures

3. **Cryptographic Validation**
   - Commitments match expected format
   - Shares decrypt successfully
   - Proofs verify correctly

### Final Verification

1. **Test Signature Generation**
   ```
   Test message: "Test DKG completion"
   Participants needed: 2 of 3
   
   P1 signature share: ‚úÖ
   P3 signature share: ‚úÖ
   Combined signature: ‚úÖ Valid
   ```

2. **Address Derivation**
   - All participants should derive same addresses
   - Verify against expected derivation path
   - Check on blockchain (if previously used)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: SD Card Not Detected
**Solution:**
- Check card reader connection
- Try different USB port
- Verify card format (FAT32)
- Test with different SD card

#### Issue: Share Verification Fails
**Solution:**
- Verify correct round 1 commitments imported
- Check participant ID mapping
- Ensure shares from correct round
- Re-export and try again

#### Issue: Different Public Keys Derived
**Critical:** Stop immediately
- Review all imported data
- Check for missing shares
- Verify participant ordering
- May need to restart ceremony

### Recovery Procedures

#### Participant Unavailable
- If before Round 1: Restart with fewer participants
- If after Round 1: Cannot proceed, must restart
- Consider (t, n-1) threshold if possible

#### Corrupted Data
- Request re-export from source
- Verify checksums before importing
- Use backup SD card if available

## Security Best Practices

### During Ceremony

‚úÖ **Physical Security**
- Never leave SD cards unattended
- Use tamper-evident seals
- Maintain visual contact during transfers
- Two-person rule for coordinator

‚úÖ **Data Hygiene**
- Wipe SD cards before use
- Secure deletion after ceremony
- No copies on hard drives
- No cloud backups ever

‚úÖ **Operational Security**
- No phones in ceremony room
- No network devices present
- Document everything
- Multiple witnesses preferred

### After Ceremony

üîí **Key Share Storage**
- Encrypt with strong password
- Store in secure location
- Consider hardware security module
- Never store on networked device

üîí **Backup Procedures**
- Create encrypted backups
- Store in separate location
- Test recovery procedure
- Document recovery process

üîí **Ongoing Security**
- Regular key share verification
- Scheduled signing ceremonies
- Maintain air-gap discipline
- Update security procedures

---

## Signing Operations (Post-DKG)

### Offline Signing Process

The same SD card exchange process is used for signing:

1. **Transaction Creation**
   - Coordinator creates transaction
   - Exports to SD card
   - Distributes to signers

2. **Share Generation**
   - Each signer generates signature share
   - Exports share to SD card
   - Returns to coordinator

3. **Signature Assembly**
   - Coordinator combines shares
   - Verifies final signature
   - Broadcasts transaction (if going online)

### Timeline
- Simple signing: 1-2 hours
- Complex transactions: 2-4 hours
- Emergency signing: Have predetermined fast-track process

---

## Compliance & Documentation

### Required Documentation

- [ ] Ceremony attendance log
- [ ] Participant identity verification
- [ ] Timeline of all operations
- [ ] Hash of all exchanged files
- [ ] Final wallet configuration
- [ ] Participant contact information
- [ ] Recovery procedures

### Audit Trail

Maintain records of:
- Every SD card exchange
- All file operations
- Verification results
- Any anomalies or issues
- Resolution of problems
- Final success confirmation

---

## Conclusion

Offline DKG provides maximum security for MPC wallet creation at the cost of operational complexity. By following this guide carefully and maintaining strict security discipline, you can create highly secure distributed wallets suitable for protecting high-value assets.

**Remember:**
- Security is only as strong as the weakest link
- Take your time - rushing leads to mistakes
- When in doubt, stop and verify
- Document everything for audit purposes
