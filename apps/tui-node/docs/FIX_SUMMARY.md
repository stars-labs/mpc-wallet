# MPC-2 Crash Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Application Crash When Joining DKG Session
**Problem**: The application would crash when mpc-2 attempted to join a DKG session.

**Root Cause**: The `DKGProgress` component was passing an invalid percentage value to the ratatui `Gauge` widget. During initialization, `progress_percentage` could be `NaN` or `Infinity` when dividing by zero (if `total` is 0).

**Error Message**: 
```
Percentage should be between 0 and 100 inclusively
at ratatui-0.29.0/src/widgets/gauge.rs:73:9
```

**Fix Applied** (`src/elm/components/dkg_progress.rs`):
```rust
// Ensure percentage is valid (0-100) before passing to Gauge
let safe_percentage = if self.progress_percentage.is_nan() || self.progress_percentage.is_infinite() {
    0
} else {
    self.progress_percentage.clamp(0.0, 100.0) as u16
};

let gauge = Gauge::default()
    .block(Block::default().borders(Borders::NONE))
    .gauge_style(Style::default().fg(self.get_round_color()).bg(Color::Black))
    .percent(safe_percentage)
    .label(progress_label);
```

### 2. Arrow Keys Not Working on Join Session Page
**Problem**: Arrow keys were not functional on the Join Session screen, preventing navigation between available sessions.

**Root Cause**: The `ScrollUp` and `ScrollDown` message handlers in `update.rs` did not have cases for `Screen::JoinSession`.

**Fix Applied** (`src/elm/update.rs` lines 952-973 and 1044-1066):
Added handling for JoinSession screen in both ScrollUp and ScrollDown message handlers to allow proper navigation with arrow keys.

### 3. TTY Detection Issues in Testing Environment
**Problem**: The application would fail to start with "No such device or address (os error 6)" when testing with FORCE_TTY=1.

**Root Cause**: The `enable_raw_mode()` and `disable_raw_mode()` calls would fail when not in a real TTY, even when FORCE_TTY was set.

**Fix Applied** (`src/elm/app.rs`):
```rust
// Skip raw mode operations when FORCE_TTY is set
if std::env::var("FORCE_TTY").unwrap_or_default() != "1" {
    crossterm::terminal::enable_raw_mode()?;
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Panic Handling
**Problem**: Crashes were silent and difficult to diagnose.

**Fix Applied** (`src/bin/mpc-wallet-tui.rs`):
Added comprehensive panic handler to capture and log panic details including message, location, thread, and backtrace.

## Testing Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Application no longer crashes when joining DKG sessions
- ✅ Gauge percentage is properly bounded between 0-100
- ✅ Arrow key navigation works on Join Session screen
- ✅ TTY detection properly handles FORCE_TTY environment variable
- ✅ Panic handler successfully captures and logs any crashes

## Files Modified

1. `/apps/tui-node/src/elm/components/dkg_progress.rs` - Fixed gauge percentage calculation
2. `/apps/tui-node/src/elm/update.rs` - Added JoinSession arrow key handling
3. `/apps/tui-node/src/elm/app.rs` - Fixed TTY mode handling for testing
4. `/apps/tui-node/src/bin/mpc-wallet-tui.rs` - Added panic handler

## How to Test

1. Run mpc-2 to join a DKG session:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin mpc-wallet-tui -- --device-id mpc-2
   ```

2. Navigate to Join Session screen and use arrow keys to select sessions

3. Join a DKG session - it should no longer crash

4. For automated testing:
   ```bash
   FORCE_TTY=1 cargo run --bin mpc-wallet-tui -- --device-id mpc-2
   ```
