## Summary Statistics

- **Total Tests Run**: 219
- **Passed**: 204 (93.2%)
- **Failed**: 15 (6.8%)
- **Errors**: 1

## Key Issues to Address

1. **Permission Service**: Issues with storage initialization and null origin handling
2. **Extension CLI Interop**: Error handling for invalid formats needs improvement
3. **WebRTC DKG**: Package handling and validation issues
4. **WebRTC Errors**: Duplicate package detection not working correctly
5. **WebRTC Signing**: Signer selection logic issue

## Recommendations

1. Focus on fixing the permission service storage initialization issue first
2. Review the WebRTC DKG package handling logic, especially the package map structure
3. Improve error handling in the extension CLI interop tests
4. Fix the duplicate package detection in WebRTC error scenarios
5. Debug the signer selection logic in WebRTC signing
