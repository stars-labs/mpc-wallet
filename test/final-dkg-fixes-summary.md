# Final DKG Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes made to resolve the DKG synchronization issues.

## Complete List of Fixes

### 1. Missing acceptSession Handler Registration
**Problem**: The offscreen document wasn't registering the acceptSession handler.
**Fix**: Added handler registration in offscreen/index.ts

### 2. Buffered Packages Cleared During DKG Init
**Problem**: `_resetDkgState()` was clearing buffered Round 1 packages during DKG initialization.
**Fix**: Save and restore buffered packages around the reset.

### 3. Replay Logic Not Triggering Round 2
**Problem**: After replaying buffered Round 1 packages, the system wasn't checking if it should proceed to Round 2.
**Fix**: Added Round 2 transition check after replay with proper state validation.

### 4. Own Round 1 Package Not Added to WASM
**Problem**: The node's own Round 1 package was never added to the FROST DKG WASM instance.
**Fix**: Explicitly add own package after generation using `frostDkg.add_round1_package()`.

### 5. Round 2 Package Map Key Format - Endianness
**Problem**: Different curves use different endianness for their 64-character hex keys.
- secp256k1: Big-endian ("0000...0001")
- ed25519: Little-endian ("0100...0000")
**Fix**: Try both endianness formats when looking up packages in the map.

## Key Insights

1. **WASM Package Requirements**: All Round 1 packages (including own) must be explicitly added to WASM.

2. **Endianness Matters**: The key format in Round 2 package maps depends on the curve:
   - secp256k1 uses big-endian (leading zeros, number at end)
   - ed25519 uses little-endian (number at beginning, trailing zeros)

3. **Synchronization is Critical**: Buffering and replay logic ensures packages aren't lost when peers start DKG at different times.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Own Round 1 package is added to WASM
- [x] Buffered packages are preserved during DKG init
- [x] Replay triggers Round 2 when conditions are met
- [x] secp256k1 finds packages with big-endian keys
- [x] ed25519 finds packages with little-endian keys
- [x] All peers complete DKG successfully

## Success Indicators

1. "Adding own Round 1 package to FROST DKG with index X"
2. "Found package using big-endian key..." (for secp256k1)
3. "Found package using little-endian key..." (for ed25519)
4. "Sent Round 2 package to mpc-1 (index 1)"
5. "Sent Round 2 package to mpc-3 (index 3)"
6. "Successfully sent 2 Round 2 packages"
7. "DKG completed successfully. Group public key: ..."
