=== DKG Round 2 Generation Fix ===

The issue has been fixed! The problem was that after replaying buffered Round 1 packages,
the system wasn't checking if it should proceed to Round 2 and generate its own Round 2 package.

🔧 What was fixed:
In the _replayBufferedDkgPackages method, after processing all buffered Round 1 packages,
I added logic to check if all conditions are met to proceed to Round 2:
- Check if we have all Round 1 packages from all participants
- Check if WASM can_start_round2() returns true
- If both conditions are met, transition to Round 2 and generate our Round 2 package

📋 To test the fix:

1. Rebuild the extension:
   bun run build

2. Reload the extension in Chrome

3. Start 3 instances and create a session

4. Watch for these log messages in mpc-2:
   - "🔄 Final WASM can_start_round2 after replay: true"
   - "🔄 Post-replay check: hasAllPackages=true, canStartRound2=true"
   - "🔄 All Round 1 packages received after replay. Moving to Round 2."
   - "Broadcasting Round 2 package to X peers"
   - "Sent WebRTCAppMessage to mpc-1: {"webrtc_msg_type":"DkgRound2Package"...}"
   - "Sent WebRTCAppMessage to mpc-3: {"webrtc_msg_type":"DkgRound2Package"...}"

5. Verify that all peers complete DKG successfully

🔍 Expected behavior:
- mpc-2 should now generate and send its Round 2 package after processing buffered Round 1 packages
- All peers should exchange Round 2 packages
- DKG should complete successfully with a group public key

💡 Success indicators:
- All peers show "DKG state update: Complete"
- Group public key is generated and matches across all peers
- Ethereum address is derived from the group public key
