=== DKG Synchronization Fix Test Guide ===

The issue has been fixed! The problem was that the _resetDkgState() method was clearing
the buffered Round 1 packages during DKG initialization, causing them to be lost before
they could be replayed.

🔧 What was fixed:
1. Modified initializeDkg() to save buffered packages before resetting DKG state
2. Restore the buffered packages after the reset
3. Added detailed logging to track the buffered packages

📋 To test the fix:

1. Rebuild the extension:
   bun run build

2. Reload the extension in Chrome

3. Start 3 instances and create a session

4. Watch for these new log messages in mpc-2:
   - "🔄 Saving X Round 1 and Y Round 2 packages before reset"
   - "🔄 Restored X Round 1 and Y Round 2 packages after reset"
   - "🔄 round1Packages array length: X"
   - "🔄 round1Packages contents: [...]"
   - "🔄 Replaying Round 1 package from mpc-1"
   - "✅ Successfully processed buffered Round 1 package from mpc-1"

5. Verify that all peers reach "DKG Complete" status

🔍 Expected behavior:
- mpc-2 should now properly replay mpc-1's buffered Round 1 package
- All peers should progress through Round 1 and Round 2
- DKG should complete successfully with a group public key

💡 If the issue persists:
1. Check that the buffered packages are being saved and restored (look for the new log messages)
2. Verify that the replay loop is executing (look for "🔄 Replaying Round 1 package from...")
3. Check for any errors in the package processing

🎯 Success indicators:
- All peers show "DKG state update: Complete"
- Group public key is generated
- No "Missing Round 1 packages" warnings
