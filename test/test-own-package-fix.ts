=== DKG Own Package Fix ===

The issue has been fixed! The problem was that when generating Round 1, the node's own
package was never added to the FROST DKG WASM instance. This caused can_start_round2()
to return false even after receiving all packages.

🔧 What was fixed:
1. In _generateAndBroadcastRound1(), after generating the Round 1 package,
   we now explicitly add it to FROST DKG using add_round1_package()
2. Updated comments to reflect that the own package needs explicit addition
3. This ensures WASM has all 3 packages (including our own) before Round 2

📋 To test the fix:

1. Rebuild the extension:
   bun run build

2. Reload the extension in Chrome

3. Start 3 instances and create a session

4. Watch for these new log messages in mpc-2:
   - "Adding own Round 1 package to FROST DKG with index 2"
   - "Successfully added own Round 1 package. Total: 1"
   - After receiving all packages: "WASM can_start_round2=true"
   - "All Round 1 packages received and can proceed. Moving to Round 2."
   - "Broadcasting Round 2 package to 2 peers"

5. Verify that all peers complete DKG successfully

🔍 Expected behavior:
- mpc-2 adds its own package to FROST DKG immediately after generation
- After receiving packages from mpc-1 and mpc-3, can_start_round2() returns true
- mpc-2 generates and sends its Round 2 package
- All peers complete DKG with matching group public keys

💡 Key insight:
The FROST WASM implementation requires ALL packages (including our own) to be
explicitly added via add_round1_package(), even though we generated it ourselves.

🎯 Success indicators:
- All peers show "DKG state update: Complete"
- Group public key matches across all peers
- No "can_start_round2: false" after receiving all packages
