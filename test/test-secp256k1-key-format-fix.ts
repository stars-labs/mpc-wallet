=== secp256k1 Round 2 Package Map Key Format Fix ===

The issue has been identified and fixed! The secp256k1 WASM implementation uses
64-character padded hexadecimal keys for the Round 2 package map, not simple
string indices.

🔧 What was the issue:
- Package map keys were in format: "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
- Our code was looking for: "1", 1, or 40-char padded keys
- This caused "No Round 2 package found" errors

🔧 What was fixed:
- Now we first try 64-character padded hex keys (e.g., "0".padStart(64, '0'))
- This matches the format used by secp256k1 WASM
- Other formats are kept as fallbacks for compatibility

📋 To test the fix:

1. Rebuild the extension:
   bun run build

2. Reload the extension in Chrome

3. Start 3 instances and create a session with Ethereum blockchain

4. Watch for these success messages in mpc-2:
   - "Package map keys: ["0000...0001","0000...0003"]"
   - "Found package using 64-char padded key "0000...0001""
   - "Sent Round 2 package to mpc-1 (index 1)"
   - "Found package using 64-char padded key "0000...0003""
   - "Sent Round 2 package to mpc-3 (index 3)"
   - "Successfully sent 2 Round 2 packages"

🔍 Key difference between curves:
- secp256k1: Uses 64-character padded hex keys (big-endian style)
- ed25519: May use different key format (to be verified)

🎯 Success indicators:
- mpc-2 successfully sends Round 2 packages to both peers
- All peers complete DKG
- No "ERROR: No Round 2 package found" messages
