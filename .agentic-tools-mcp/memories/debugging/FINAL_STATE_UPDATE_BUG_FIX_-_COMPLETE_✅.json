  "details": "## POPUP STATE LOADING ARCHITECTURE FIX ✅\n\n### Root Cause Analysis - State Overwriting Problem\nUser identified the core architectural issue: The popup was **overwriting** background state instead of **loading** from it. Each popup open was:\n\n1. ❌ **Sending** UI preferences to background immediately (before loading state)\n2. ✅ **Receiving** initial state from background (but getting overwritten)\n\n### Specific Problem in Logs\n```\n🔌 [Background] Popup connected\n[StateManager] Sending initial state to popup  \n📄 [PopupMessageHandler] Processing: createOffscreen\n🌐 [PopupMessageHandler] Processing: setBlockchain  ← This happens BEFORE initial state is processed!\n```\n\nThe reactive statement `$: if (appState.chain && port && appState.chain !== lastSentBlockchain)` was firing **immediately** when the popup opened, before the real state was loaded from background.\n\n### Architectural Fix Applied\n\n#### 1. **Prevent Premature Reactive Statements**\nAdded `initialStateLoaded` guard to blockchain reactive statement:\n```javascript\n$: if (initialStateLoaded && appState.chain && port && appState.chain !== lastSentBlockchain) {\n  console.log(\"[UI] Chain selection changed to:\", appState.chain, \"(after initial state loaded)\");\n  // ... send to background\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. **Enhanced Debug Logging**\nAdded comprehensive logging to track state loading flow:\n```javascript\nport.onMessage.addListener((message) => {\n  console.log(\"[UI] Port message received:\", message.type, message);\n  // Track when initial state is received\n  if (message.type === \"initialState\" && !stateReceived) {\n    stateReceived = true;\n    console.log(\"[UI] Initial state received successfully from StateManager\");\n  }\n  handleBackgroundMessage(message);\n});\n```\n\n#### 3. **Initialize State Loading Flag**\n```javascript\nonMount(async () => {\n  // Initialize as false to prevent reactive statements from running\n  initialStateLoaded = false;\n  \n  port = chrome.runtime.connect({ name: \"popup\" });\n  console.log(\"[UI] Port connected to background, waiting for initial state...\");\n});\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior After Fix\n1. **Popup opens** → `initialStateLoaded = false`\n2. **Background sends initial state** → `initialState` message with real WebRTC/WebSocket state\n3. **Popup processes initial state** → `initialStateLoaded = true`\n4. **Reactive statements can now fire** → Only send changes, not initial values\n\n### Result\n- ✅ Background state persists correctly (WebRTC, WebSocket, session info)\n- ✅ Popup loads real-time state from background first\n- ✅ UI preferences still persist in localStorage\n- ✅ No more premature state overwriting\n- ✅ Proper separation: Background = real-time state, Popup = UI preferences\n\n**Status: Architecture Fixed ✅**",
