  "details": "## Session Auto-Acceptance UI Bug Analysis - PERSISTENCE ISSUE IDENTIFIED ✅\n\n### Problem Description\nUser reports session invitations showing as \"already accepted\" in UI even when user hasn't clicked accept. State persists when reopening popup, indicating backend state corruption.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nAfter deep investigation of the session workflow and persistence logic, I identified **CRITICAL MISSING PERSISTENCE FOR INVITES**:\n\n#### PERSISTENCE MECHANISMS ISSUE:\n1. **SessionPersistenceManager** - Only saves/loads `sessionInfo` (accepted sessions), completely ignores `invites`\n2. **StateManager.persistState()** - Also only saves `sessionInfo`, NOT `invites`\n\n```typescript\n// StateManager persistence - MISSING INVITES\nconst stateToPersist = {\n    sessionInfo: this.appState.sessionInfo, // ✅ Saved\n    // invites: this.appState.invites,       // ❌ NOT SAVED\n    // ... other state\n};\n```\n\n#### CONSEQUENCE:\nWhen extension restarts or popup reopens:\n- Pending invites are LOST from persistence\n- Only active `sessionInfo` is restored\n- If a session was improperly moved to `sessionInfo` without user acceptance, it persists incorrectly\n\n### SESSION WORKFLOW ANALYSIS:\n1. **Normal Invitation Flow (correct):**\n   - Peer A proposes → Session added to Peer B's `invites[]` with status \"proposed\"\n   - UI shows in \"Pending Invitations\" section\n   - User clicks \"Accept\" → Moved to `sessionInfo` with status \"accepted\"\n\n2. **Proposer Auto-Acceptance (correct):**\n   - User proposes → `handleProposerAutoAcceptance()` immediately sets `sessionInfo` with status \"accepted\"\n\n3. **PERSISTENCE BUG:**\n   - `invites[]` are never persisted across restarts\n   - If sessions incorrectly end up in `sessionInfo`, they persist as \"accepted\"\n\n### Files Examined:\n- `/src/entrypoints/background/sessionManager.ts` - Session logic appears correct\n- `/src/entrypoints/background/stateManager.ts` - Missing invites persistence\n- `/src/entrypoints/popup/App.svelte` - UI logic is correct (shows sessionInfo as active, invites as pending)\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Add invites persistence** to StateManager\n2. **Verify no auto-acceptance logic** is incorrectly moving sessions from invites to sessionInfo\n3. **Test invitation workflow** after persistence fix",
