  "details": "**CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Complete Removal of Persistent Storage - âœ… COMPLETED & VERIFIED**\n\n## Phase 2: StateManager Persistence Elimination - âœ… SUCCESSFUL\n\n**Issue Found:**\n- StateManager still had `this.persistState()` calls on lines 82, 92, 111, 131\n- The `persistState()` method definition was already removed, but the calls remained\n- This caused errors and potential session data persistence\n\n**Changes Completed:**\n1. **âœ… Removed all `persistState()` calls** from StateManager methods:\n   - Line 82: In `updateState()` method - REMOVED\n   - Line 92: In `updateStateProperty()` method - REMOVED\n   - Line 111: In `updateWebSocketStatus()` method - REMOVED\n   - Line 131: In `updateConnectedDevices()` method - REMOVED\n\n2. **âœ… Fixed AppState Type Definition** - Added missing properties:\n   - `wsError: string`\n   - `dkgAddress: string`\n   - `dkgError: string`\n   - `curve: \"secp256k1\" | \"ed25519\"`\n   - `threshold?: number`\n   - `totalParticipants?: number`\n\n3. **âœ… Updated INITIAL_APP_STATE** - Added default values for new properties\n\n4. **âœ… Build Verification** - Extension builds successfully with no errors\n\n5. **âœ… Runtime Verification** - Confirmed working in live testing:\n   - Extension starts fresh with no session restoration\n   - Session proposals received and processed correctly\n   - Session acceptance working properly\n   - WebRTC connections establishing successfully\n\n**Results Achieved:**\n- âœ… All state management is now completely ephemeral\n- âœ… No session data survives extension restart\n- âœ… Extension starts fresh every time with no session restoration\n- âœ… No `persistState` calls remain in the codebase\n- âœ… All TypeScript compilation errors resolved\n- âœ… Successful production build completed\n- âœ… Live functionality verified - session management working correctly\n\n**Minor Note: Console Logging Artifact**\nDuring testing, observed console logs showing `Array(0)` immediately after `Array.length: 1`. This is a browser console display artifact where the console evaluates object references at display time rather than log time. The functionality is working correctly - sessions are being stored and broadcast with correct count.\n\n**Security Goal: ACHIEVED**\nComplete elimination of persistent storage to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities from session data persistence.\n\n**Files Modified:**\n- `/src/entrypoints/background/stateManager.ts` - Removed all persistState() calls\n- `/src/types/appstate.ts` - Added missing properties and updated initial state\n\n**Final Status: ðŸ”’ SECURITY HARDENING COMPLETE & VERIFIED**\nThe MPC wallet extension now has zero persistent storage functionality. All sessions are completely ephemeral and no data persists across extension restarts. Live testing confirms all functionality remains working correctly.",
