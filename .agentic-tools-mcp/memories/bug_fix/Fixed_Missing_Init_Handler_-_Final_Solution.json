  "title": "Fixed Missing Init Handler - Final Solution",
  "details": "## FINAL SOLUTION: Fixed Missing `init` Message Handler in Offscreen Document\n\n### Root Cause Identified ✅\nThe issue was **NOT** a missing handler registration - the `init` handler was properly registered. The real problem was a **missing setup call** and **competing message listeners**.\n\n### The Real Problem:\n1. **Missing Setup Call**: `messageRouter.setupMessageListener()` was never called in the initialization\n2. **Competing Listeners**: There were TWO Chrome message listeners setup:\n   - MessageRouter's internal listener (via `setupMessageListener()`)\n   - Manual listener in offscreen/index.ts at line 424\n\n### The Fix Applied:\n1. **Added Missing Setup Call** in `initializeModules()`:\n   ```typescript\n   // Set up the message listener - this was missing!\n   messageRouter.setupMessageListener();\n   ```\n\n2. **Removed Duplicate Listener** - Removed the manual Chrome runtime listener that was competing with MessageRouter's internal listener\n\n### Files Modified:\n- `/src/entrypoints/offscreen/index.ts`\n  - Added `messageRouter.setupMessageListener()` call after handler registration\n  - Removed duplicate Chrome runtime message listener\n\n### Technical Details:\n- The MessageRouter class has its own `setupMessageListener()` method that properly handles message routing\n- The manual listener was interfering with the MessageRouter's internal processing\n- Both listeners were trying to handle the same messages causing conflicts\n\n### Expected Result:\n- Offscreen document will now properly receive and handle `init` messages\n- \"localdeviceId: null\" warnings should be eliminated\n- Device ID will be correctly transmitted and stored in offscreen document\n\n### Build Status: ✅ \n- Build successful: 798.91 kB\n- No TypeScript errors\n- Ready for testing\n\n### Key Insight:\nWhen using a MessageRouter pattern, ensure the router's setup methods are called and avoid duplicate manual listeners that can interfere with the routing logic.",
